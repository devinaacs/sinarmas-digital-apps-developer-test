# Number Reverse Difference Calculator

A React application that calculates the absolute difference between a number and its reverse.

## Overview

This app takes a whole number input, calculates its reverse (removing leading zeros), and displays the positive difference between the original and reversed numbers.

**Examples:**
- Input: `21` → Reverse: `12` → Difference: `9`
- Input: `30` → Reverse: `3` → Difference: `27`
- Input: `1.2` → Filtered to: `12` → Reverse: `21` → Difference: `9`

## Features
